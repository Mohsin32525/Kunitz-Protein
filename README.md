# Kunitz-Protein
The Kunitz domain plays critical role in inhabiting proteases and is widely conserved across many biological systems due to its functional and structural significance. In this study a hidden Markov Model (HMM) was developed specifically to identify Kunitz type domains within protein sequences. The model was trained using a multiple sequence alignment generated from structural aligned representative proteins ensuring that key conserved structural features were accurately captured. This (HMM) model was then applied as a binary classification tool to determine the presence or absence of domain in curated datasets sourced from UniProt/SwissProt. The Models performance was rigorously evaluated using cross-validation and comprehensive testing. Results demonstrated strong predictive accuracy and reliability with performance indicators such as overall accuracy and the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) validating its effectiveness. Additionally, the study demonstrates the value of integrating structural insights with sequence based approaches to enhance Protein domain detection while also identifying gaps and Inconsistencies in current protein annotation databases.
